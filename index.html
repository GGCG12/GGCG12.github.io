       <p> <strong>In this trip, we will be going to visit some mountains that go just along the surface of the lake you can see on the picture.</strong> <br></p>
       <p> The <strong class="trip">trip</strong> will extend in various ways, starting with an offroad track, we will get inside a 4x4 truck, for it to leave us half the way in, then, we will continue by mountain bikes till getting into the right track, when we hit the track, we will be doing a little bit of <em>trail</em> running. </p> 
       <h2>Getting there</h2>

        <br>
        As you can see, <em>the path</em> isnÂ´t easy at all, but I can say it will all be <strong>worth</strong> it when we get there. The steps to get there going from the perspective of the camera are:
        <ol>
            <li> Taking the nearest path going down to the front.
            <li> Turn right when you see a sign.
            <li> Turn left when you catch the tracks.
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Things to consider</h3>

        <ol>
            <li> The path is rough and really long, keep a water bottle near.
            <li> Make sure to pack everything, since it is almost isolated.
            <li> Eat something before starting and enjoy the trip. </ol>

           <strong> If you read this, you are ready to go to the lake between the mountains.</strong>
